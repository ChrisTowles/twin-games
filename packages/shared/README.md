## Excluding peerDependencies

On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies) how to do that.

Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.js`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.
