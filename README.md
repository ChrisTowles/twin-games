## History and Technolgy Stack

I originally started this project in Flutter and Firebase/Firestore.  However, Firestore Functions don't allow for Cloud Firestore triggers to watch for Firestore db changes when written in dart. So I'd have to maintain both a typescript version of the backend logic and Dart for the frontend.....

I'll note someone tried to write a solution for dart [here](https://github.com/pulyaevskiy/firebase-functions-interop) but i had issues getting it to work it and the repo appears to be a dead. Also Google apparently has no intention to support Firestore triggers from dart as a issue is several years old and they've stated there are no plans to support it. 

Also, the billing model for Firestore can be scary. Being charged for any query i didn't design tables with lookup documents. That takes a lot of planning and if you fail to do so end up having to query every document. That's a billable action.

I then started working a version of this project that used flutter and web sockets to a node backend.  However, even with `socket.io` there is a lot of considerations and design that needs to go into how to set up your message passing. Which I never worked out. 

So when I decided to try this project for the third time I was looking for an example of a good socket based web game and i found [nakama](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/) which looks to provide even better functionality for my use case.

Also, as I'm already rather proficient in Typescript and Vue, I should be much more productive than I this time vs trying to learn flutter at the same time.
